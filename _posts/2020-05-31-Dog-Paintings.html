<h3> Meet Cookie and Pepper.</h3>

<p>These are my family's dogs. We rescued them from the shelter back in 2013. Because they are rescues, we don't really know
what breed they are. The shelter said they were both black lab mixes of some sort.
When we first got them, many people thought Cookie was momma and Pepper was her baby (Pepper was much slimmer back then).
But they are not related. We got them both simply because they were in the same pen. 
They have been great companions over the years, bringing us many smiles and laughs. 

Quarantine has forced me to explore different activities to engage my mind, take up my time, and make me happy. I bought
a couple canves of off Amazon so I could make painting one of these activities. I do not really have a need for paintings in my
house and I don't particularly enjoy usless trinkets lying around, so I knew I was going to be painting gifts for other people. Mother's 
day allowed me to get a couple canvases off my hands, but I was stumped after that. 

Maybe it was a FaceTime call where my family held up Cookie and Pepper for me to see, or a video my sister sent of them
being goofballs, but something planted the idea in my head that I would paint portraits of my dogs for my dogs.
Now I am not an art student and in no way do I identify myself as an artistic person. However, I am a stubborn, hard-working, perfectionist
person. So once I got this portrait idea in my head I could not let it go. I picked 2 pictures I thought I could make a painting out of:</p>

I sketched on the canveses first, going through a whole eraser until I got them the way I wanted, then took forever trying to 
paint black dogs and not just black blobs.

I was pleasantly surprised with the way my paintings turned out, so much so that I wanted to share them.
Guess it goes to show that if you put your mind to something you really can make it happen.

I think I might make painting a new hobby now. It is very relaxing. I love painting and listening to a podcast at the same time.
When you're done, you feel accomplished. It is like the same feeling I get when I finish a program. There is something about creating something
with your own brain and hands that is extremly satisfying. I will have to figure out new muses though. Maybe I will paint my pet ball python next :P. I'll also have to figure out what to do with
my paintings. My family will eventually get tired of me giving them as gifts.

Anyways, if there's anything you can take from this post, besides your daily dose of dog cuteness of course, maybe it is that you can
do that activity that you thought was outside of your abilities. If you think it will be fun, go for it! Maybe you will discover a hidden talent.
You will probably have fun regardless of the outcome and really that is all that matters. Make some quarantine memories,
explore new depths of your soul, go paint some dogs.
